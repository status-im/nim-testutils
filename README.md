# Testrunner [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/disruptek/testutils.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/disruptek/testutils)

## Usage
Command syntax:
```
testrunner [options] path
Run the test(s) specified at path. Will search recursively for test files
provided path is a directory.
Options:
--targets:"c c++ js objc" [Not implemented] Run tests for specified targets
--include:"test1 test2"   Run only listed tests (space/comma seperated)
--exclude:"test1 test2"   Skip listed tests (space/comma seperated)
--help                    Display this help and exit
```

The runner will look recursively for all `*.test` files at given path.

## Test file options
The test files follow the configuration file syntax (similar as `.ini`), see also
[nim parsecfg module](https://nim-lang.org/docs/parsecfg.html).

### Required
- **program**: A test file should have at minimum a program name. This is the name
of the nim source minus the `.nim` extension.

### Optional
- **max_size**: To check the maximum size of the binary, in bytes.
- **timestamp_peg**: If you don't want to use the default timestamps, you can define
your own timestamp peg here.
- **compile_error**: When expecting a compilation failure, the error message that
should be expected.
- **error_file**: When expecting a compilation failure, the source file where the
error should occur.
- **os**: Space and/or comma separated list of operating systems for which the
test should be run. Defaults to `"linux, macosx, windows"`. Tests meant for a
different OS than the host will be marked as `SKIPPED`.
- **--skip**: This will simply skip the test (will not be marked as failure).

### Forwarded Options
Any other options or key-value pairs will be forwarded to the nim compiler.

A **key-value** pair will become a conditional symbol + value (`-d:SYMBOL(:VAL)`)
for the nim compiler, e.g. for `-d:chronicles_timestamps="UnixTime"` the test
file requires:
```
chronicles_timestamps="UnixTime"
```
If only a key is given, an empty value will be forwarded.

An **option** will be forwarded as is to the nim compiler, e.g. this can be
added in a test file:
```
--opt:size
```

### Outputs
For outputs to be compared, the output string should be set to the output
name (stdout or filename) from within the "Output" section, e.g.:
```
[Output]
stdout="""expected stdout output"""
file.log="""expected file output"""
```
Triple quotes can be used for multiple lines.

### Supplying Command-line Arguments

Specify command-line arguments as an escaped string in the following syntax:

```
args="arg1 arg2 arg3"
```

Each new `args` specification instantiates a new test execution with the most-recently-specified outputs.

```
stdout="6"
args="2 * 3"
args="3 * 2"

stdout="7"
args="3 + 4"
```
